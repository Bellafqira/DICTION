# DICTION:	DynamIC robusT whIte bOx watermarkiNg scheme

Deep neural network watermarking is a suitable method for protecting the ownership of deep learning (DL) models derived from computationally intensive processes and painstakingly compiled and annotated datasets. It embeds a secret identifier (watermark) within the model, which can be retrieved by the owner to demonstrate ownership. Deepsigns is one of the earliest effective dynamic  white-box watermarking techniques. It has the benefit of maintaining the accuracy of the prediction model without altering the statistical distribution of the model activation maps. In the case of large watermarks, however, DeepSigns watermarked models are vulnerable to multiple attacks. In order to maintain the robustness of DeepSigns, the number of message bits that can be inserted into a model is limited. In this paper, we provide a common framework to formalize the white box watermarking schemes and we propose a novel dynamic white box watermarking scheme "DICTION" that generalizes "Deepsigns". Its originality is derived from adversarial learning using data generated from a latent space. Experiments conducted on the same model test set as Deepsigns demonstrate that our scheme achieves a higher capacity than Deepsigns without sacrificing accuracy or robustness.
